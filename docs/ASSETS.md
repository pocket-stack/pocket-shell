# Repository assets

Commit the definitions needed to build a shell, the inputs that cannot be
recreated from this checkout, and selected documentation and test fixtures.
Build intermediates and individual validation runs stay ignored.

| Files | Role and retention |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop `gen-icons.ts` | Original pixel grids and vector definitions; retained as source. Its 100 SVG outputs in `src/system-ui/icons/` are ignored and regenerated before builds. |
| Desktop `gen-assets.ts`, W95FA OTF and its OFL notice | Font recipe and original input; retained. The ten 1×/2× `.bin` atlases in `src/system-ui/fonts/` are ignored. Inter comes from the pinned PocketJS submodule. |
| 3DS `src/wall/*.png` and `images.json` | The three texture inputs the guest uses. The preparation script needs external Omarchy originals and macOS `sips`; deleting the only bundled inputs would break a clean build. |
| iPod `src/fonts/SymbolsNerdFont-subset.otf` and its license | Shipped font input. The complete Nerd Font used to make this subset is not stored here. |
| iPod `src/menu.ts` | Versioned Omarchy menu snapshot. Regeneration reads an external machine or JSONC file; ordinary builds must not depend on a live Omarchy installation. The source version and digest are in its header. |
| 3DS `test/goldens/3ds/*.png` and `AZAHAR-BUILD.txt` | 26 reference frames consumed by `film --check`, plus the emulator version. Regenerating these during a check would remove the comparison baseline. |
| 3DS and iPod `media/`, desktop `docs/*-theme.png` | Selected pictures and scripted animations embedded in the shell READMEs; desktop theme images are also shipped on the site. These are reviewed documentation assets. |
| Desktop `docs/bench/classic-2026-08-23.{md,json}` | Historical baseline cited by the website, including measured data and protocol. It predates the portable renderer. |
| Desktop `docs/bench/aqua-gpu-2026-09-10.{md,json}` | Dated comparison supporting the documented drag benchmark. It measures CPU submission and capture estimates, not physical input latency. |
| Desktop `docs/bench/text-offload-{latency.json,welcome.txt}` | The dated text-service measurement and exact input cited by the text documentation. |
| TypeScript/TSX, C, HTML, CSS and preview JavaScript | Maintained application, daemon, build or site source. Wayland protocol XML is the input to the pointer helper's build and retains its embedded MIT notice. |
| Package/runtime manifests, tsconfigs, CI, Bun lockfile and `.gitmodules` | Build and dependency inputs. There is one root PocketJS gitlink and one workspace lockfile. |
| GPL texts and third-party notices | Distribution terms; generated font atlases keep the source fonts' OFL terms. See [LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md). |

The SVG and atlas generators reproduced all 110 previously committed outputs
byte-for-byte during this cleanup. Native, web and simulator builds now invoke
them automatically; the standalone wrap test and site build with
`--reuse-preview` also prepare their inputs. Run `bun run desktop assets` to
regenerate explicitly. Each generator replaces its own output directory so
removed source definitions cannot leave stale assets behind.

Seven unused PNGs and the old portable-runtime integration report, its machine
receipt and three device screenshots were removed from the current tree. They
remain in Git history. Their local review copies are under ignored
`.pocket-build/validation/asset-review/removed/`. The iPod's four scripted GIFs
remain documented in its README.

New benchmark runs write to ignored `.pocket/bench/` directories. Promote a
selected, reviewed baseline into `docs/bench/` explicitly with its protocol,
source revisions and a document that uses it. Smoke screenshots, traces,
resolved plans, packages and binaries stay under ignored `dist/`, `.pocket/`
or `.pocket-build/`.

`bun run check:assets` rejects tracked ignored files, broken local Markdown
links, missing tape goldens and media with no documentation, test or declared
source consumer. It runs as part of `bun run check` and in CI.
